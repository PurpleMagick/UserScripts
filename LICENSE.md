## Earlier Contributions
As of 2020-04-15T00:00:00.000Z, all future contributions to this repository are licensed under the MIT License.

Unfortunately, there was no actual license for contributions prior to that date. As such, in order for the code that existed prior to that to have a license, each earlier contributor must individually agree to license their existing contributions under the MIT License.

As a result, the license for the code in this repository is complex. If you intend to use the code in this repository, you will need to verify for yourself that the portions of code you desire to use are covered under the MIT License. To know if the code has a license, or not, you will need to check if the contribution containing the original version of the code you desire to use was made on or after 2020-04-15T00:00:00.000Z or if the author of the contribution has added their name below.

### Agreement by authors to license contributions made prior to 2020-04-15T00:00:00.000Z

Authors who made contributions prior to 2020-04-15T00:00:00.000Z can indicate their agreement to license their earlier contributions under the MIT License by editing this file with the GitHub account from which the prior contribution(s) were made and adding their GitHub username below.

Individuals who have no contributions prior to 2020-04-15T00:00:00.000Z may optionally add their name to the list below, but just making a contribution after that date indicates agreement to license such new contribution under the above MIT license.
